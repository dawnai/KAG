　　看到一个新闻，在热搜短暂的停留几分钟，然后就消失不见；

　　顺着这个词条再搜索，才能找到媒体报道，而且那些原本的大媒也已经消失在词条，只剩下一些地方媒体报道还在。

　　脉络也不复杂，大意是四川广安的一位老人在家中熏腊肉，然后被社区工作人员收取了200元的教育管理费。????????????????

　　除了这个教育管理费之外，老人还签下了保证书。???

　　然后这件事被上传到网络，

　　当地的镇政府回应说，已经对社区的工作人员进行了严肃的批评教育，在今后的工作中要注重方式方法，老人的200元钱也已经退还。??????????

　　二，

　　这件事，对于正能量们来说，屁大的事，不就200块钱嘛！?

　　但一滴水映射而出的是一个庞大的氛围。????

　　首先，这个说是社区，其实是个镇子，老人在家里露天熏制腊肉，代表着是独门独院的乡村房子，也所以不是居民楼那些会造成隐患，影响邻居的那种地儿。说实话，咱们该有多少人是在农村出来的，露天一个锅烧柴火做饭的年月没过去几年的。农村不都是烧柴火做饭吗？熏腊肉也是一种地方上的习俗，逢年过节，这个时候还有二十几天过年了，这个老人按照自己幼年时期父母留下来的传统，在家里备一点腊肉过年，说实话，不过分的。大气污染这个东西，和几年前流行的烧秸杆污染大气是一种说辞。真正造成污染的并非是农村的这点，祖祖辈辈烧柴火的年月，晚上的天都是不用照灯的。???????????????????????

　　讲到烧秸杆，我印象很深的是一个和熏腊肉新闻同样遭遇的另一个老人，

　　看到下面这个检讨了没，私自烧秸杆，愿意接受处罚，永不再烧秸杆。

　　再看下面这个画面，这100元钱的罚款，说实话，我看到后心是在颤抖的。我不知道这些罚款者当时是用什么样的心态来拿这个钱的。???????????????

　　当时我为这个老人写过文章；当时有着诸多的正能量说烧桔杆违法，不能因为年龄大就同情之类的。但现在呢，说烧桔杆污染的专家结果证实是个汉奸，被抓了，而人民日报今年也开始站出来说话了，?????

　　现实中不少政策只是看上去“很美”。

　　其次，讲一个法律概念，媒体的报道说实话已经给这个社区很大的脸面，将这个200元钱定义为教育管理费。再说白了，什么教育管理费，不就是罚款吗？????

　　但问题是，社区工作人员是没有执法权的，国家并未赋予社区罚款的权力，也就是说，这本就是违法行为。而非是一句教育管理费。如是之，我一个普通人走在街上，看到一个瘦小的人，上去就推一把，请你给我一点保护费，两百元就可以。那么这是什么行为？??????????????????????????

　　还有便是，一个现实的问题。

　　200元，对于那些看直播，给网红随便刷一个小礼物的人来说，可能也就是博美人一笑的一下下，对更多那些主流牛逼人物来说，200元仿佛就不是钱一样，但对于一些乡镇的老人来说，200元可能是养了几年的一只母鸡，几个月攒下来不舍得吃的鸡蛋。

　　同样的200元，朋友们，厚度是不一样的！????

　　也所以，人，一定要有人该有的味道。

　　三，

　　至于其他的，真的不想说。当地教育管理费真的只有这一个老人吗？无非是这个老人幸运的被人看到而已。也所以，这不是一个孤立的200元事件，这背后或许还有着很多200元已经拿出去，而没有退回来的老人。??

　　我以前是经常到这些乡镇的，我亲眼见证过无数的上面这个拿一只母鸡摆在路边等着售卖的老人，他们要卖掉自己养了可以下蛋的母鸡，或许只是为了换一点食用油回家做菜，或许也只是为了去医院买一点药，或许是为了其他的应急。??????????????????????

　　说实话，我写到这里时很难过的。是无法继续再延展这样一个人间的脉络。

　　四，

　　去年的这个时候，也算是我极为落魄的一段难捱时间，那个时候我还在宝山水产路附近，当时一位老人家，也是一位从警四十多年赋闲在家养老的一位智者邀我去吃饭，因为我俩关系还算不错，疫情被封的那几个月，我们当时在一个楼层，然后气到不行，总之就是我俩冲出了那道防线，在空阔的大街上散步了半天，然后算是患难之交的那种吧，什么话都可以说。?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

　　我记得吃饭的时候他问我，你天天写，其实是写不完的。尤其是你看你关注的这些都是小事，其实没大意思和前途。他说，依照他的人生经验，写文章有两个出路。要么是宏大吹牛逼，当然，这个吹牛逼不是谄媚拍马屁，而是海阔天空，经史子集，国际那种，受众基本很多，掺杂一些历史，气场开得足够，这样的文章受众基本很多；要么是发现美，看到美，人对美都是有着天然的兴致，而非是。。。??????????????

　　讲到这里，他隐晦的对我说，你写的这个都是人间之恶，尤其是底层的挣扎，说实话，看文章的其实大多又都是中产。总之我的方向不对。

　　我没有反驳，而是思考，深度思考的那种。??

　　然后我说，我其实很懒，不会去考虑那么多，也可能我自己就是底层，就是看到有表达欲的事情表达出来罢了，如果按照您所说的对的方向，我可能做不下来，也写不出来。也就是说，我不是那种天然的生意人，可能我这辈子就这样了，一是懒，二是也不愿动脑子去想那么多。????????????

　　他听后也沉默，就不再继续这个话题了。

　　五，

　　我记得很清楚，当时在回来的路上，我脑海里萦绕着的是纪伯伦的那些话：“我们活着只为的是去发现美。其他一切都是等待的种种形式。”????

　　我也不愿：“我睁开眼睛，看到的是一片黑暗；我张口说话，说出的全是悲伤。”?

　　其实很多的时候，看到黑的，将心里的悲伤表达出来，也是为了美。",2403,,2025-01-09 06:49:46,两岸三地＞百家论坛,,美国华裔教授专家网,,,,百家论坛｜现实中不少政策只是看上去“很美”,70250109155714000113,美国〉,N03,2025010916,2025/1/9 17:01:13,2025/1/9 17:01:13,1

　　For Alberta businesses, this is a worrisome period surrounding the country’s most important trading partnership, arriving at a critical time when much of Ottawa will be increasingly focused on who will become Canada’s next prime minister to replace Justin Trudeau.

　　“Businesses are preparing today for the very strong likelihood that they will see tariffs. If they are in the most severe version — the 25 per cent across the working board — it’d be economically devastating,” Scott Crockatt of the Business Council of Alberta said Tuesday.

　　“This just sort of underscores the reason we need very, very strong representation for Canada to both nurture and negotiate the next chapter in the most important bilateral relationship on Earth, which is Canada and the United States.”

　　On Tuesday, Trump held a lengthy news conference, reiterating his threat to impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada. He previously vowed to put a 25 per cent levy on all products from both countries if they don’t stop illegal drugs and migrants from entering the country.

　　But just a day after Trudeau announced he would step down as prime minister, Trump ramped up the rhetoric.

　　He insisted the U.S. is “not treated well” by Canada due to a trade deficit — largely due to America buying energy — and he talked about using “economic force” to make Canada the 51st U.S. state.

　　“Canada and the United States, that would really be something. You get rid of that artificially drawn line and you take a look at what that looks like, and it would also be much better for national security,” Trump said.

　　“We don’t need their cars. We don’t need their lumber . . . We don’t need anything, so why are we losing $200 billion a year and more to protect Canada?”

　　Trudeau responded quickly on social media, saying there isn’t “a snowball’s chance in hell” that Canada would become part of the United States.

　　There isn’t a snowball’s chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States.

　　Workers and communities in both our countries benefit from being each other’s biggest trading and security partner.

　　— Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) January 7, 2025

　　Setting aside Trump’s growing rhetoric, Statistics Canada reported Tuesday that the country’s trade surplus with the U.S. increased to $8.2 billion in November. The biggest part of Canada’s trade with the U.S. comes from natural gas and oil, which feeds refineries, particularly in the U.S. Midwest.

　　Putting tariffs in place would boost energy prices for U.S. consumers, and some analysts believe oil and gas will not be hit by the Trump administration. Canada is the largest foreign energy supplier to the United States, providing about 60 per cent of American oil imports in 2023.

　　“Nobody wins” if tariffs are applied on Canadian oil and gas, said Lisa Baiton, CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.

　　“The impact of a tariff in any form, it affects American energy prices and it will impact Canadian production, and that, in turn, is going to have significant negative consequences for our producers and for the Canadian economy,” Baiton said in an interview.

　　“It’s a critical moment for Canada . . . We’re just under two weeks from a president coming in and we have a whole lot of political uncertainty here at home, at a time when we should have all our ducks in a row and be on our front foot to protect Canada.”

　　The new data show how big that cross-border trade is and what’s at stake for this province.

　　According to ATB Financial, 89 per cent — or $147 billion — of provincial exports moved south during the first 11 months of 2024.

　　If a 25 per cent tariff was adopted by the U.S., Alberta exports would drop and the province’s economy would contract by about 0.3 per cent this year, instead of growing by an expected 2.5 per cent, ATB analysis indicates.

　　However, that recessionary outlook is not ATB’s base-case scenario.

　　ATB chief economist Mark Parsons noted more than 30 per cent of Canadian exports to the U.S. were energy products.

　　And even with increasing shipments of oil to Asia through the expanded Trans Mountain pipeline, 94 per cent of all Canadian energy exported in November went into the U.S.

　　“A lot of Canadian wealth and prosperity is driven by our U.S. trade, and in particular trade in energy products to the U.S.,” said Parsons.

　　“We are very exposed.”

　　Mark Parsons, vice president and chief economist for ATB Financial, speaks to media at the 2025 Economic Outlook event hosted at the BMO Centre on Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2024. Brent Calver/Postmedia

　　Relative to ATB’s base case, Alberta business investment would dip by six per cent and total international exports would fall by four per cent under a 25 per cent tariff scenario, as much of the oil headed south would continue to flow, although at a discounted price, he said.

　　As this tariff talk unfolds, Canada will soon see a federal Liberal leadership race and, potentially, a federal election.

　　For businesses, this is a troubling moment, particularly with the political turmoil on the federal scene and the need for a forceful response.

　　Calgary Chamber of Commerce CEO Deborah Yedlin would like to see a strategy developed and economic analysis undertaken to fully understand the effect of any tariffs on various sectors, and how to best counter those effects.

　　“This is a time to have strong leadership, because without strong leadership, weaknesses are exploited,” Yedlin said.

　　“We are starting on our back foot, we are not starting from a position of strength. And businesses need certainty and they need stability in order to risk capital.”

　　Companies including Mara Holdings Inc., Riot Platforms Inc. and CleanSpark Inc. have used the soaring price of bitcoin, which hit US$100,000 last month, to raise more than US$3.7 billion from investors since November, which they have then used to fund the purchase of the coins. They have often raised the funds through zero, or near-zero, coupon convertible notes.

　　Their moves come in the wake of Donald Trump‘s election victory, with the incoming U.S. president having promised that bitcoin would be “mined, minted and made in the USA.”

　　But for many, the headlong rush to buy more of the currency they are also mining comes down to protecting themselves against further financial pressure from high energy costs.

　　“It’s not as simple as the price of bitcoin has gone up and everyone’s happy,” said Russell Cann, chief development officer at Core Scientific Inc. “Complex challenges still remain around profitability and access to the grid.”

　　The miners’ ambitious plans, which also include expanding capacity for artificial intelligence (AI), mark a sharp reversal of outlook for the industry, which has struggled over the past eight months after the reward they receive for mining bitcoin halved.

　　Miners compete with each other to validate blocks of new transactions in bitcoin, making them a crucial link in ensuring the bitcoin network is secure and reliable.

　　The computer programs that run the bitcoin network are designed to halve the reward available to miners every four years. The latest, in April, cut the spoils on offer for miners from 900 to just 450 coins a day.

　　CoinShares International Ltd., the investment group, estimated that the average cost to produce one bitcoin for all U.S.-listed miners rose to US$55,950 in the third quarter, up 13 per cent on the previous quarter. Including depreciation and stock-based compensation charges, the average cost to produce a bitcoin was US$106,000. On Monday the cryptocurrency was trading at about US$102,175.

　　“If the price didn’t rise, then we would have started to see quite a few start to turn rigs off or go bust,” said James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.

　　But the soaring price of bitcoin has pushed up one gauge of mining profitability, known has the hash price, which has risen 32 per cent since Trump’s victory. That glimmer of hope has prompted many miners to return to capital markets in search of fresh funds.

　　Some, such as Mara and Riot, are now taking their lead from MicroStrategy Inc., a software group turned bitcoin purchaser that has led the way in issuing long-term convertible bonds to buy bitcoin. Miners are also promising to make the cryptocurrency the reserve asset for their corporate treasuries, increasing their bitcoin reserves and retaining all the new coins they mine.

　　“This ‘Trump bump’ has essentially given us more impetus to continue to invest in the U.S.,” said Fred Thiel, chief executive of Mara Holdings. Its business model now is to “accumulate as much bitcoin as [we] can.” It now has nearly 45,000 bitcoin, worth more than US$4.4 billion.

　　Asher Genoot, chief executive of Hut 8 Corp., considers his company an “energy infrastructure” group with bitcoin as the financial base of its balance sheet.

　　In two months, the industry has plowed about US$1.8 billion of what it has raised into buying bitcoin.

　　However, the pressure on the miners has not abated. The collective amount of computing power required to secure the network, known as the hash rate, has continued to climb as new entrants come into the market. It hit an all-time high on Friday. The rising rate threatens to counteract the benefits of bitcoin’s price increase, further squeezing corporate profits.

　　“We are seeing a stratospheric rise in the bitcoin hash rate, highlighting a massive amount of new hardware coming online, making those at the higher end of cost of production much more vulnerable?if we see a price correction,” Butterfill said.

　　The U.S. industry is also facing fierce competition for resources at home. It has long been under pressure to justify its energy usage. The U.S. Energy Information Agency estimates mining may already use 2.3 per cent of the country’s grid, although, with limited access to data, predictions vary.

　　The Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index estimates that bitcoin trading at about US$100,000 uses the same annualized energy as Poland.

　　Utility regulators in Texas demanded in November that all data centre facilities that consume more than 75 megawatts provide annual energy data. The state is the largest in the United States for crypto mining and authorities are predicting that demand for energy from large users will jump 60 per cent in 2025.

　　Executives say the bigger challenge comes from large-scale AI developers who have greater financial resources than miners.

　　“Artificial intelligence demand in the U.S. is going to greatly affect how much bitcoin mining can be added to the grid,” said Core Scientific’s Cann, who predicted that the majority of computing power for bitcoin in coming years would be outside the U.S.

　　“It’s just math to say: Is [the grid]’s best use as a bitcoin mining facility, or as an AI data centre? And right now, from an economics perspective, it’s going to be AI,” said Cann.

　　Mara aims to offshore half of its mines by 2028, expanding in places that have surplus energy, such as Kenya, the United Arab Emirates and Paraguay.

　　But others are trying to finder faster routes to profits by riding the AI wave. The Nvidia graphic processing units used for cryptocurrency mining also lend themselves to handle the vast quantities of data for AI. Hut 8, Core Scientific and Hive have all pivoted to leasing their data centre capacity to artificial intelligence hyperscalers (large-scale computing companies).

　　“Yes, bitcoin’s up, and it really helps, but if energy prices were to spike tomorrow, it’s still a tough day to be a bitcoin miner,” said Zach Bradford, chief executive of CleanSpark, a U.S.-listed cryptocurrency miner.

　　The Delhi High Court has set aside an order of the Central Information Commission directing the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to demand information from the phone service provider and give it to a customer under the RTI Act.

　　Justice Sanjeev Narula said Trai requesting information from telecom service providers (TSP) was confined to fulfilling its regulatory functions and did not extend to addressing individual grievances or accessing customer-specific information solely for dissemination under the RTI framework.

　　The high court, in its order, said the CIC's observation requiring a customer to seek redressal before the consumer disputes redressal forum was misplaced and beyond its statutory mandate.

　　 

　　""Trai is not a service provider or a consumer under the Consumer Protection Act, and any grievance against Trai's actions or inactions must be pursued before the TDSAT (Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal), as established under the Trai Act. By making observation and issuing directions unrelated to the scope of the RTI Act, the CIC undermined the legislative framework governing the resolution of telecom disputes,"" it said.

　　The court therefore allowed Trai's plea against the CIC order.

　　""The court finds merit in the petitioner's challenge to the impugned order. The CIC erred in directing Trai to requisition information from the TSP, Vodafone, and provide it to the respondent (consumer) under the RTI Act,"" the court held on January 7.

　　The consumer registered his cellphone number under the ""fully blocked"" category of the national do not call registry and despite requesting this service, Vodafone allegedly altered his ""do not disturb"" status without consent.

　　Aggrieved by the inaction on his formal complaints to the service provider, the man sought recourse under the RTI Act to obtain details on the status of his complaints.

　　The central public information officer provided him with the information but still dissatisfied, he filed an appeal and matter eventually landed in the CIC.

　　In June 2024, the CIC directed Trai to demand information on the man's complaints from Vodafone, and provide it to him under the RTI Act.

　　Trai, in its plea in the high court, argued the directive misconstrued the regulatory framework established under the Trai Act and wrongly expanded the scope of Trai's powers, rendering the order legally unsustainable.

　　The court acknowledged the larger issue of unsolicited commercial communications raised by the consumer that impact a sizeable population.

　　The Bombay High Court on Wednesday granted bail to researcher Rona Wilson and activist Sudhir Dhawale, arrested in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case, noting that they were in jail since 2018 and the trial was yet to start. A division bench of Justices A S Gadkari and Kamal Khata said the two had spent more than six years in jail as under-trial prisoners.

　　""They are in jail since 2018. Even the charges in the case are yet to be framed. The prosecution has cited over 300 witnesses, and thus there is no possibility of the trial to conclude in the near future,"" the court said. A trial starts after the charges are framed.

　　 

　　The NIA, the prosecution agency, did not seek a stay to the HC order.

　　Defence lawyers Mihir Desai and Sudeep Pasbola had argued that the two accused were incarcerated since their arrest in the case.

　　While granting relief, the high court said it was not dealing with the merits of the case at this stage. Wilson and Dhawale were directed to submit a surety of Rs one lakh each, and appear before the special NIA court for the trial hearing.

　　They shall surrender their passports and not leave the city until the trial is over, the HC said.

　　Rona Wilson was arrested in June 2018 from his home in Delhi. He was described by the probe agencies as one of the top brass of urban Maoists.

　　Dhawale was accused of being an active member of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist). Apart from Dhawale and Wilson, 14 other activists were arrested in the case. Eight of them -- Varavara Rao, Sudha Bharadwaj, Anand Teltumbde, Vernon Gonsalves, Arun Ferreira, Shoma Sen, Gautam Navlakha and Mahesh Raut -- have been granted bail till now. Mahesh Raut remained in jail as the appeal filed by the NIA against his bail is pending before the Supreme Court. But on Tuesday the special NIA court granted him interim bail for 18 days to enable him appear for an LLB exam. Stan Swamy, one of the accused, died in 2021 while in prison. The case pertains to provocative speeches allegedly delivered at the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, triggering violence at Koregaon-Bhima in Pune district the next day.

　　The Pune police had claimed the conclave was backed by the Maoists.

　　The NIA later took over the probe.

　　Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu on Wednesday said there has been an increase in the enrolment rate in elementary education and a reduction in the dropout rate at the secondary level in the state.

　　He said the state has achieved a notable reduction in the dropout rate at the secondary level to 11.7 per cent.

　　Khandu wrote on X, ""Our concerted efforts have yielded remarkable outcomes. The Adjusted Net Enrolment Rate in elementary education has reached an impressive 100 pc. Similarly, the average annual school dropout rate at the secondary level has reduced significantly."" 

　　The chief minister credited Team Arunachal for driving impactful changes in the education sector. He highlighted that the initiatives are aligned with the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the goals outlined in the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.

　　 

　　""In sync with the grand vision of Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji, as brilliantly captured in the new National Education Policy-2020, Team Arunachal is giving a big push to the state's educational landscape through a set of well-crafted interventions and enabling measures,"" Khandu said in another social media post.

　　Innovative programmes like 'Building as Learning Aid' and the establishment of new Eklavya Model Residential Schools have ensured that modern educational facilities are accessible to every child, reinforcing our commitment to inclusive and quality education for all, the chief minister added.

　　According to the 2024 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Scoreboard, this milestone is part of Arunachal Pradesh's strides in achieving the global education goal under SDG 4.

　　A local court has fixed March 5 as the next date of hearing in a case connected to the Mughal-era Shahi Jama Masjid and its survey at Chandausi.

　　""The Supreme Court has directed all the lower courts not to entertain new suits seeking surveys of any place of worship until further orders. We have filed a copy of the said order in the court, which fixed March 5 as the next date of hearing,"" Shakil Ahmad Wari, advocate representing the Muslim side, told reporters.

　　When told about the Hindu side's claims that the mosque was built over an ancient Harihar temple, Wari said it is for the court to decide on the matter.

　　 

　　""We will prove in the court that it was not a Harihar temple, but Jama Masjid. We have all the evidence,"" he said.

　　Tensions escalated in Sambhal since November 19 last year, when a court-mandated survey of the Shahi Jama Masjid began following claims that a Harihar temple once stood on the site.

　　The situation turned violent on November 24 during the second survey when protesters clashed with security forces. The ensuing stone-pelting and arson left four persons dead and many others injured.

　　近年国际上备受推崇的得舒降血压饮食法(DASH diet)，是一个有效改善高血压饮食方案。究竟方法如何？

　　DASH得舒饮食法主要透过摄取丰富的镁、钙、钾、膳食纤维及不饱和脂肪酸，来降低、控制高血压及预防心血管疾病。

　　DASH得舒饮食法五大原则：

　　1. 主食选择全谷物

　　尽量以全谷类(如糙米、燕麦米、紫米等)取代白米、白面等精致淀粉。

　　2. 蔬果5+5

　　每日应摄取约5份水果和5份蔬菜。

　　选择含较高水溶性纤维及果胶的蔬果，如菇类、木耳、苹果等。

　　水溶性纤维有助降低坏胆固醇、血压及增加血管弹性。

　　水果和蔬菜的分量：

　　1份水果约等於切块后能装满1个碗。

　　1份蔬菜约等於能装满八成的碗。

　　水果可选高纤高钾类，如香蕉，有助降血压。

　　蔬菜可选含纤维、钙质的西兰花、菜心、秋葵等。

　　3. 选择低脂乳品

　　每日摄取1至2杯低脂乳品，如低脂乳酪、乳酪饮品或芝士。

　　乳品含钙，有助稳定血压。

　　4. 以白肉代替红肉

　　选择白肉(如鱼肉、鸡肉、鸭肉)取代红肉以吸收蛋白质。

　　避免高饱和脂肪及反式脂肪食物：

　　饱和脂肪主要来自动物性脂肪(如牛腩、排骨)。

　　反式脂肪常见於松化、高温焗制的食物(如酥皮、油炸食品)。

　　过量的油脂会增加心血管疾病风险。

　　5. 选好油、食坚果

　　使用橄榄油、沙拉油、芥花油等植物油，取代猪油、奶油等动物油。

　　每日可摄取约10粒坚果(如腰果、开心果、核桃)，补充丰富不饱和脂肪酸。

　　三文鱼、沙甸鱼和黄花鱼含奥米加3脂肪酸，建议每周进食2次(每次约100克)。

　　鸡蛋、黄豆及豆类制品同样含优质蛋白质，属健康低脂之选。

　　世界衞生组织(WHO)建议成人每日的钠摄取量应少於2,000毫克(相等於1茶匙盐)，2克的钠等於5克的盐。控盐可从减少使用调味料，及避免食用加工及腌制食物入手。 除了盐、豉油及蚝油外，其实调味料如鸡粉、鲜露、海鲜酱、茄汁等亦含不少盐分。日常烹调时，建议多使用姜、蒜蓉、洋葱、胡椒、各式香草等天然低钠调味料为食材增添味道。天然调味料含有不同的植物抗氧化物，有利血管健康。外出进食时，应避免“捞汁”吃饭，酱料亦尽量另上，以减少钠质摄取。

　　两类人需要特别留意：

　　肾功能衰退人士：得舒饮食含有高钾、高磷和高钙，若本身肾功能不佳或肾功能衰退人士，建议可询问医生或营养师。

　　糖尿病患者：得舒饮食主张多水果、多蔬菜。然而，水果含有不少果糖，有些蔬菜亦含高淀粉质。建议由营养师跟进饮食，以评估自己是否适合采用这个饮食方案。",1177,,2025-01-09 00:00:00,column,,am730,,,,天气冷血压高｜营养师推介DASH得舒饮食,70250109155914000114,香港〉,HK03,2025010916,2025/1/9 17:01:11,2025/1/9 17:01:11,1
